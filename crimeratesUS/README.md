Crime rates in the US
=======

Yearly crime counts from fbi ![](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf).  While it's a nice time series to play with, in the end it is based on local data and so is more of a trend of reporting practices than actual crime.
