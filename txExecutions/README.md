Last Statements of Executed Offenders in Texas
=======

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) provides a table with various bits of info on the [main offender page](https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html). Each entry has links specific to the individual, with some redundant information such as age and county, but which unfortunately may not be consistent.  For example, county is listed on the main table, the individual's page will (possibly) have it relisted (variable countyorCountry in the dataset), in addition to nativeCounty, and nativeState.  


We retain the original data scraped from the TDCJ site plus versions that are enhanced or deemed more accurate in terms of value, spelling, etc. In cases where one is interested in a variable that is duplicated, the one marked 'variable2' should be preferred. Other variables that are engineered from these use the one marked with a '2' as well (e.g. years on death row). Most of the problematic variables of this sort were not prevalent enough to use for analysis, but perhaps more will be filled in over time.


While we'd like to make more corrections ourselves and are happy to do so to any found, ultimately it is the job of the TDCJ to maintain accurate records, not ours. The data set works for demonstration and exploration, but should not be taken too far.
